#### **Steps:**

1. Create UI components for logging sets, reps, and weight for each exercise.
2. Implement logic for tracking and suggesting overload (based on user data).
3. Create graphs to visualize progress and track overload history.
4. Implement feedback on when to increase weights or reps.

---

### **Correlation Graphs**

#### **Key Features:**

- Show relationships between sleep, calorie intake, exercise, and progress over time.

#### **Tools & APIs:**

- **MPAndroidChart** for graph generation.
- **Room Database** to store correlated data.

#### **Steps:**

1. Define key metrics to correlate: sleep, calories, exercise data, body measurements.
2. Store these data points in **Room Database**.
3. Implement graphs using **MPAndroidChart** to show correlation over time.

---

### **Body Measurements Tracking**

#### **Key Features:**

- Track body measurements such as weight, waist, chest, hips, and more.
- Visualize progress through graphs.

#### **Tools & APIs:**

- **Room Database** for body measurements tracking.
- **MPAndroidChart** for graphing measurements over time.

#### **Steps:**

1. Create input fields for different body measurements.
2. Store the measurements in the local database (Room).
3. Create graphs to visualize progress over time.

---

### **Recovery Tracking**

#### **Key Features:**

- Track recovery time after workouts.
